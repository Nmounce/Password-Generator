Password-Generator
HW Assignment #3 fro UC Davis Coding Bootcamp

# Description
This module is designed to generate a secure password based on randomization or data. Fields for uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols can be selected or de-selected based on user preference. The field for password length can also be customized within a range of 8 to 128 characters, depending on the preffered length. Upon clikcing "Generate Password" a new Secure Password will appear based on the selected parameter. The screen will reset to the defualt parameters upon refresh. It may not be pretty, but it works!

# How to use
Indicate the preferred password length by using the arrows to increase or decrease the number in the "Password Length" field. You may then indicate if you wish to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols by selecting or de-selecting the parameter by clicking on the check box (default is checked). Finally, click the "Generate Password" button and the random secure password will appear in the field above titled "Your Secure Password".
